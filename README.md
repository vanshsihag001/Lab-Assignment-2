CSS3 — Styling, layout, and responsiveness This is a personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and contact details as a web developer. It’s designed with a clean, responsive layout, smooth scrolling navigation, and accessible features like a “Skip to About” link. The goal of this site is to create a simple yet professional online presence while I continue learning front-end web development.
